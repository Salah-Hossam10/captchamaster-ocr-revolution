Project Overview
This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize CAPTCHA text in images. The model processes grayscale CAPTCHA images through a series of convolutional layers, batch normalization, dropout layers, and dense layers to classify each character in the CAPTCHA image.

Dataset
Images and labels should be stored in the following format:

Images Folder: /kaggle/working/samples
Annotations: Labels are extracted from filenames (e.g., A12G9.png for CAPTCHA text A12G9).
Ensure that images are in a format like .jpg or .png to be processed correctly by the model.

Preprocessing
A preprocessing pipeline was implemented to enhance image quality, including:

CLAHE for contrast enhancement.
Gaussian Blur to reduce noise.
Adaptive Thresholding for binarization.
Normalization to scale image pixel values.
Model Architecture
The CNN architecture includes:

Input Layer: Processes 80x160 grayscale images.
Convolutional Layers: 32, 64, and 128 filters for feature extraction.
Max Pooling and Spatial Dropout for regularization.
Dense Layers: Fully connected layers with 256 and 128 nodes, plus batch normalization.
Output Layers: Separate softmax layers for each character position to predict each character independently.
Training and Augmentation
The model applies data augmentation to enhance training diversity. Random rotations and brightness adjustments are used to simulate real-world variations. The model is trained with the following parameters:

Optimizer: Adam with a learning rate of 0.001.
Loss: Categorical cross-entropy for each character output.
Callbacks: Early stopping, learning rate reduction, and model checkpointing.
Dependencies
To install dependencies, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Main Packages:

tensorflow and keras
numpy
opencv-python
scikit-learn
How to Run
Data Preparation: Place the images in the folder specified in the code (/kaggle/working/samples).
Training: Adjust the parameters in the script, such as MAX_IMAGES and label_length, then run:

python train_model.py
Model Evaluation: The model saves the best version as best_captcha_model.keras for easy loading and evaluation.
Future Improvements
Incorporate synthetic data generation to increase dataset diversity.
Experiment with LSTM or Transformer-based models to improve sequence-based recognition.
Integrate a web interface to deploy the model as a CAPTCHA solver API.
